    <p class="des"><small>"The Aegis Avenger Titan is the base variant of the Avenger. With the extra cargo space and
        the Avenger's tried and true combat abilities, the Titan is a light cargo hauler that's more than capable of
        handling itself in a fight. The Avenger Titan's loadout is nearly identical to the Stalker, with only the
        wingtip Suckerpunch cannons being replaced."
